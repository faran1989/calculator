Takhmino is a financial decision-support platform.
It does NOT predict outcomes.
It provides estimation tools to clarify uncertainty.

Communication rules:
- Avoid deterministic language (no “will”, no guaranteed outcomes).
- Avoid hype/motivational copy.
- Keep tone neutral, clear, and honest.

Engineering rules:
- Follow Next.js App Router best practices.
- Maintain server/client separation.
- Do not change folder structure unless necessary.
- If a structural change is needed: explain impact + trade-offs, then wait for user approval.

Output rules:
- Always output complete, ready-to-replace files (no partial patches).
- Respect existing contracts in CLAUDE.md.
